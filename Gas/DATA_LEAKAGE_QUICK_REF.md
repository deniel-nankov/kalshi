# Data Leakage Fix - Quick Reference

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

**Problem:** `retail_margin` feature caused data leakage  
**Formula:** `retail_margin = retail_price - price_rbob`  
**Impact:** Model could perfectly reconstruct target from features

## 📊 Before vs After

### Metrics Comparison

| Model | Metric | Before | After | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Ridge | Train RMSE | $0.00016 | $0.087 | ✅ Realistic |
| Ridge | Test RMSE | $0.00016 | $0.091 | ✅ Realistic |
| Ridge | Test R² | 0.9999 | -1.977 | ⚠️ Needs tuning |
| P50 Quantile | Pinball | 0.0000 | 0.0386 | ✅ Realistic |

## 🔧 Code Changes

**File:** `src/models/baseline_models.py`

**Line 28-29 (Before):**
```python
"crack_spread",         # Refining margin (RBOB - WTI)
"retail_margin",        # Retail markup over RBOB
"rbob_lag3",            # 3-day RBOB lag
```

**Line 28-29 (After):**
```python
"crack_spread",         # Refining margin (RBOB - WTI)
# "retail_margin",      # ❌ REMOVED: Causes data leakage
"rbob_lag3",            # 3-day RBOB lag
```

**Feature count:** 22 → 21

## ✅ Verification

### Test 1: Perfect Reconstruction (Before Fix)
```python
reconstructed = df['retail_margin'] + df['price_rbob']
error = abs(reconstructed - df['retail_price']).mean()
# Result: $0.0000000000 ← LEAKAGE CONFIRMED
```

### Test 2: Realistic Errors (After Fix)
```python
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
error = abs(predictions - y_test).mean()
# Result: $0.076 ← REALISTIC
```

## 📝 Files Affected

### Modified
- ✅ `src/models/baseline_models.py` (removed retail_margin)

### Retrained
- ✅ `outputs/models/ridge_model.pkl`
- ✅ `outputs/models/inventory_model.pkl`
- ✅ `outputs/models/futures_model.pkl`
- ✅ `outputs/quantile_regression/*.txt`

### Documentation

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Leakage resolved
2. ✅ Models retrained
3. ✅ Metrics realistic

### Future (Performance Tuning)
1. ⏳ Feature selection (reduce to 10-15 best)
2. ⏳ Hyperparameter optimization
3. ⏳ Try lagged retail_margin (7, 14 days)
4. ⏳ Test non-linear models (XGBoost, RF)
5. ⏳ Rerun walk-forward validation

## 🔑 Key Learnings

1. **Feature = Target - Other Feature** → Data Leakage
2. **R² = 0.9999** → Investigate immediately
3. **Zero pinball loss** → Impossible in practice
4. **Test = Train performance** → Red flag
