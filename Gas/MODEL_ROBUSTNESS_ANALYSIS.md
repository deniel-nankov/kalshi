# Model Robustness & Training Effectiveness Analysis

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Question:** "How do we know we're training models effectively for our use case? How do we know models are robust?"  
**Status:** üîç CRITICAL ANALYSIS REQUIRED

---

## Executive Summary

**Current Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY VALIDATED** - System shows strong performance (Ensemble R¬≤=0.595) but has **critical gaps** in robustness validation:

### ‚úÖ What We Have
1. Walk-forward validation (5 horizons √ó 4 years = 20 tests)
2. Time-series cross-validation (respects temporal ordering)
3. Strict train/test split (Oct 1, 2024 cutoff)
4. Multiple evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, R¬≤, MAPE)
5. Regime-specific performance analysis

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Gaps
1. **No October-specific validation** (models trained on all months, tested on October only)
2. **No stability testing** (one split only - what if we used Oct 2023 as holdout?)
3. **No feature robustness** (what if inventory_surprise is noisy?)
4. **No hyperparameter sensitivity** (only tested 5 alphas)
5. **Limited walk-forward analysis** (shows forecast decay but not investigated)
6. **No ensemble weight validation** (fixed weights by regime - are they optimal?)

---

## Part 1: Current Validation Framework

### 1.1 Train/Test Split Methodology

**Current Approach:**
```python
# Single fixed split
train_data = data[data['date'] < '2024-10-01']  # 1,443 rows
test_data = data[data['date'] >= '2024-10-01']   # 377 rows (Oct 2024 - Oct 2025)

# All models use this split
results = train_all_models(train_df, test_df, features=COMMON_FEATURES)
```

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Temporal ordering preserved (no data leakage)
- ‚úÖ Test set includes full October 2024 (real use case)
- ‚úÖ Sufficient train size (1,443 observations)

**Weaknesses:**
- ‚ùå **October bias not validated:** Models trained on Jan-Dec but tested on Oct only
- ‚ùå **Single test outcome:** One unlucky October could mislead performance
- ‚ùå **No October-October train/test:** Should we train on Oct 2020-2023, test on Oct 2024?

**Risk Level:** üü° MEDIUM - Performance may not generalize to future Octobers

---

### 1.2 Time-Series Cross-Validation

**Current Approach:**
```python
# Ridge alpha selection uses 5-fold expanding window CV
RIDGE_ALPHA_GRID = [0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0]

tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)
for alpha in RIDGE_ALPHA_GRID:
    for train_idx, val_idx in tscv.split(X_train):
        # Train on X_train[train_idx], validate on X_train[val_idx]
        cv_scores.append(rmse)
    
    best_alpha = argmin(cv_scores)  # Always selects 0.01
```

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Respects temporal ordering (expanding window)
- ‚úÖ Multiple validation folds (5 splits)
- ‚úÖ Tests multiple hyperparameters (5 alphas)

**Weaknesses:**
- ‚ùå **Always selects minimal regularization (Œ±=0.01):** Suggests overfitting risk
- ‚ùå **Only 5 alpha values tested:** Should test Œ±=[0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, ...]
- ‚ùå **No nested CV:** Should use outer CV for final model selection
- ‚ùå **CV on all months, test on October:** Mismatch in seasonal distribution

**Risk Level:** üü° MEDIUM - May overfit to training data

---

### 1.3 Walk-Forward Validation

**Current Approach:**
```python
# Test 5 horizons √ó 4 years = 20 forecasts
horizons = [1, 3, 7, 14, 21]  # Days ahead
years = [2021, 2022, 2023, 2024]

for year in years:
    for horizon in horizons:
        # Train on data before Oct 1, {year}
        # Test on Oct {year} with {horizon}-day forecasts
        train_df = data[data['target_date'] < f'{year}-10-01']
        test_df = data[data['target_date'].dt.month == 10]
        
        model = Ridge(alpha=best_alpha_from_cv)
        predictions = model.predict(test_df)
```

**Results:**
| Horizon | Avg R¬≤ | Avg RMSE | Avg MAPE | Interpretation |
|---------|--------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **1-day** | 0.82 | $0.025 | 0.51% | ‚úÖ **Excellent** - 82% variance explained |
| **3-day** | 0.53 | $0.039 | 0.91% | ‚úÖ **Good** - moderate decay |
| **7-day** | 0.20 | $0.041 | 0.93% | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Weak** - large variance unexplained |
| **14-day** | -2.95 | $0.098 | 2.22% | ‚ùå **FAIL** - worse than predicting mean |
| **21-day** | -9.16 | $0.167 | 3.98% | ‚ùå **CATASTROPHIC** - 10x worse than mean |

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Simulates real-world forecasting (expanding window)
- ‚úÖ Tests multiple time horizons (1-21 days)
- ‚úÖ Multiple years (2021-2024) for stability
- ‚úÖ Shows realistic forecast decay

**Critical Finding:**
- üö® **21-day forecast is our use case (Oct 1 ‚Üí Oct 31)** but R¬≤=-9.16 is **catastrophically bad**
- üö® **This contradicts baseline test R¬≤=0.595** - something is wrong!

**Two Possible Explanations:**
1. **Data leakage in baseline:** Baseline may use features that look ahead
2. **Walk-forward underestimates:** Different preprocessing or features

**Risk Level:** üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Core use case (21-day forecast) shows R¬≤=-9.16

---

### 1.4 Ensemble Regime Validation

**Current Approach:**
```python
# Test regime performance
ensemble = RegimeWeightedEnsemble(model1, model2, model3)

for regime in ['Normal', 'Tight', 'Crisis']:
    regime_data = test_data[test_data['regime'] == regime]
    metrics = evaluate_ensemble(ensemble, regime_data)
```

**Results (Test Set):**
| Regime | % of Data | R¬≤ | RMSE | Interpretation |
|--------|-----------|-----|------|----------------|
| **Normal** (DS>26) | 69.5% | 0.578 | $0.033 | ‚úÖ Majority case working well |
| **Tight** (23<DS‚â§26) | 30.5% | 0.626 | $0.034 | ‚úÖ **Better** in tight markets! |
| **Crisis** (DS<23) | 0.0% | N/A | N/A | ‚ö†Ô∏è Never encountered in test set |

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Validates regime identification logic
- ‚úÖ Shows ensemble adapts correctly (better in Tight markets)
- ‚úÖ Confirms adaptive weighting works

**Weaknesses:**
- ‚ùå **Crisis regime never tested:** Weights [0.40, 0.40, 0.20] are untested
- ‚ùå **Only 1 test period:** What if Oct 2024 was unusually stable?
- ‚ùå **Fixed weights not optimized:** Are [0.50, 0.35, 0.15] truly optimal for Tight?

**Risk Level:** üü° MEDIUM - Crisis regime untested

---

## Part 2: Critical Robustness Gaps

### Gap 1: October-Specific Training üî¥ CRITICAL

**Problem:** Models trained on **all months** (Jan-Dec 2020-2024) but tested on **October only**

**Why This Matters:**
- Gas prices have strong seasonality (summer blend vs winter blend)
- October-specific patterns (hurricane risk, winter blend transition) may not generalize from other months
- Training on May data to predict October may introduce noise

**Evidence of Risk:**
```python
# Current approach
train_data = all_data[all_data['date'] < '2024-10-01']  # INCLUDES Jan-Sep 2020-2024
test_data = all_data[all_data['date'].dt.month == 10]   # ONLY October 2024

# This mixes seasonality!
```

**What We Should Do:**
```python
# Option 1: October-Only Training (Conservative)
train_october = all_data[all_data['date'].dt.month == 10]
train_october = train_october[train_october['date'] < '2024-10-01']  # Oct 2020-2023
test_october = all_data[all_data['date'].dt.month == 10]
test_october = test_october[all_data['date'] >= '2024-10-01']  # Oct 2024

# Option 2: Seasonal Weighting (Sophisticated)
# Train on all months but upweight October observations
sample_weights = np.where(train_data['date'].dt.month == 10, 3.0, 1.0)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, sample_weight=sample_weights)

# Option 3: Seasonal Ensemble
# Train 12 separate models (one per month), ensemble with Oct-specific weights
```

**Impact if We Fix This:** Could improve/worsen R¬≤ by 5-15% depending on October patterns

**Recommendation:** üéØ **HIGH PRIORITY** - Run October-only training comparison ASAP

---

### Gap 2: Single Test Split Instability üü° MEDIUM

**Problem:** We report R¬≤=0.595 based on **one test period** (Oct 2024-2025). What if this period was unusually easy/hard to forecast?

**Why This Matters:**
- October 2024 may have had unusually stable inventory (easy to forecast)
- Or conversely, had a hurricane that our model handled well by luck
- One favorable/unfavorable period gives misleading confidence

**What We Should Do:**
```python
# Multiple holdout tests
test_periods = [
    ('2021-10-01', '2021-10-31'),
    ('2022-10-01', '2022-10-31'),
    ('2023-10-01', '2023-10-31'),
    ('2024-10-01', '2024-10-31'),
]

results = []
for test_start, test_end in test_periods:
    # Train on all data BEFORE test period
    train_df = data[data['date'] < test_start]
    test_df = data[(data['date'] >= test_start) & (data['date'] <= test_end)]
    
    model = train_model(train_df)
    metrics = evaluate(model, test_df)
    results.append(metrics)

# Report mean ¬± std
print(f"Mean R¬≤: {np.mean([r['r2'] for r in results]):.3f} ¬± {np.std([r['r2'] for r in results]):.3f}")
```

**Expected Result:** R¬≤ = 0.55 ¬± 0.15 (wider confidence band)

**Impact:** Could reveal model is less robust than single split suggests

**Recommendation:** üéØ **MEDIUM PRIORITY** - Add multi-period validation to pipeline

---

### Gap 3: Feature Robustness Testing üü° MEDIUM

**Problem:** We use 19 features but **don't know which are critical vs noise**

**Why This Matters:**
- If `inventory_surprise` is critical but noisy, model may fail when it's unreliable
- If `basis_lag7` adds no value, we're adding complexity for nothing
- If `days_supply` drives ensemble but is miscalculated, system collapses

**What We Should Do:**
```python
# Feature ablation study
baseline_features = COMMON_FEATURES  # 19 features
baseline_r2 = train_and_evaluate(baseline_features)

feature_importance = {}
for feature in COMMON_FEATURES:
    # Remove one feature at a time
    ablated_features = [f for f in COMMON_FEATURES if f != feature]
    ablated_r2 = train_and_evaluate(ablated_features)
    
    importance = baseline_r2 - ablated_r2  # R¬≤ drop when removed
    feature_importance[feature] = importance

# Rank by importance
print("Critical features (R¬≤ drop > 0.05):")
for feat, imp in sorted(feature_importance.items(), key=lambda x: -x[1]):
    if imp > 0.05:
        print(f"  {feat}: R¬≤ drops by {imp:.3f} when removed")
```

**Expected Finding:** 5-7 features are critical, 10-12 add marginal value

**Impact:** Could simplify model to 10 features with no performance loss

**Recommendation:** üéØ **MEDIUM PRIORITY** - Run feature ablation study

---

### Gap 4: Hyperparameter Sensitivity üü¢ LOW

**Problem:** We only test 5 alpha values [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100] and always select 0.01

**Why This Matters:**
- Œ±=0.01 is minimal regularization ‚Üí risk of overfitting
- We haven't tested Œ±=0.001, 0.005, 0.05 (finer granularity)
- Other hyperparameters (e.g., ensemble weights) not validated at all

**What We Should Do:**
```python
# Finer alpha grid
RIDGE_ALPHA_GRID = [0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0]

# Test ensemble weights
weight_grid = {
    'Normal': [[0.6, 0.2, 0.2], [0.7, 0.15, 0.15], [0.8, 0.1, 0.1]],
    'Tight': [[0.4, 0.4, 0.2], [0.5, 0.35, 0.15], [0.5, 0.4, 0.1]],
}

# Grid search with walk-forward validation
best_config = grid_search_ensemble_weights(weight_grid, data)
```

**Expected Finding:** Current weights are near-optimal (¬±2% R¬≤)

**Impact:** Minor improvement (1-3% R¬≤)

**Recommendation:** üéØ **LOW PRIORITY** - Nice-to-have validation

---

### Gap 5: Walk-Forward Anomaly Investigation üî¥ CRITICAL

**Problem:** Walk-forward shows R¬≤=-9.16 for 21-day forecasts, but baseline shows R¬≤=0.595. **These can't both be correct!**

**Possible Explanations:**

**Hypothesis 1: Data Leakage in Baseline**
```python
# Baseline may be using features that look ahead
# Example: If basis_lag7 uses future data due to bug
gold["basis_lag7"] = gold["basis"].shift(7)  # CORRECT
gold["basis_lag7"] = gold["basis"].shift(-7)  # WRONG - looks ahead!

# Test: Manually verify all .shift() operations are positive
```

**Hypothesis 2: Different Feature Sets**
```python
# Walk-forward may use different features than baseline
# Check: Do both use identical COMMON_FEATURES?
```

**Hypothesis 3: Train/Test Contamination**
```python
# Walk-forward may accidentally include test data in training
# Check: Verify train_mask and test_mask are mutually exclusive
```

**What We Must Do:**
1. üî¥ **Re-run baseline with walk-forward methodology** (same splits, same features)
2. üî¥ **Audit all feature engineering for temporal leakage** (check every .shift(), .rolling(), .expanding())
3. üî¥ **Add assert statements** in train_all_models() to verify no overlap

**Impact:** Could reveal baseline R¬≤=0.595 is inflated due to leakage

**Recommendation:** üéØ **CRITICAL PRIORITY** - Resolve discrepancy immediately

---

    # Filter to October only
    october_data = df[df['date'].dt.month == 10].copy()
    
    train_df = october_data[october_data['date'] < test_start]
    test_df = october_data[october_data['date'] >= test_start]
    
    print(f"October-Only Training: {len(train_df)} rows (Oct 2020-2023)")
    print(f"October-Only Testing: {len(test_df)} rows (Oct 2024+)")
    
    # Train models
    results = train_all_models(train_df, test_df, features=COMMON_FEATURES)
    
    return results
```

                   (data['date'] < f'{test_year}-11-01')]
    
    model_results = train_all_models(train_df, test_df)
    results.append(model_results)

# Aggregate statistics
for model_name in ['Ridge', 'Inventory', 'Futures', 'Ensemble']:
    r2_scores = [r[model_name]['test']['r2'] for r in results]
    print(f"{model_name} R¬≤: {np.mean(r2_scores):.3f} ¬± {np.std(r2_scores):.3f}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Ridge R¬≤: 0.55 ¬± 0.12 (wider confidence band)
Ensemble R¬≤: 0.58 ¬± 0.15 (less certain than single split)
```

**Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Quantifies model stability

---
