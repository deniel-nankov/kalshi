Process historical hurricane risk for October from NOAA HURDAT2.

- Downloads or loads HURDAT2 data
- Computes October hurricane risk metric (e.g., probability, count)
- Saves as hurricane_risk_october.csv in data/silver/

Instructions:
- Download HURDAT2: https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/hurdat/hurdat2-1851-2022-120922.txt
- Parse for October events and compute risk
