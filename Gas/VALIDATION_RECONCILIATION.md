# Validation Reconciliation – October 2025 Forecast

**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Owner:** Validation task follow-up (automation notes recorded by Codex assistant)

## Context

- Baseline training (`train_models.py`) previously evaluated **same-day targets** while walk-forward validation evaluated **21-day ahead** forecasts.  
- This mismatch explained the conflicting metrics (test R² ≈ 0.60 vs walk-forward R² ≪ 0).  
- Robustness analysis flagged this as **critical**; model decisions based on the inflated nowcast scores were unsafe for the October 31, 2025 objective.

## Actions Taken

1. **Forecast Horizon Support**
   - Added horizon-aware target preparation in `models/baseline_models.py` via `prepare_forecast_frame`.
   - Updated `train_all_models`, `train_models.py`, and the pipeline orchestrator to accept an explicit `--horizon` argument (default 0, with 21 recommended for the October forecast).
   - Aligned walk-forward validation to reuse the same helper, guaranteeing identical feature/target construction.
   - Added safety checks to prevent temporal leakage (`target_date` is always ≥ as-of `date`).

2. **Seasonality & Stability Workflows**
   - Implemented `train_models_october_only.py` for October-specific training comparisons.
   - Implemented `multi_period_validation.py` to automate per-October holdout evaluations (2021 → 2024 by default) and summarise mean ± stdev metrics.

3. **Outputs Regenerated (Horizon = 21)**
   - `train_models.py --horizon 21` now reports ensemble test R² ≈ −0.47 (down from +0.60 under the nowcast setup).
   - Walk-forward metrics for horizon 21 remain strongly negative (e.g., 2022 Oct R² ≈ −33), confirming the original warning.
   - October-only training further amplifies this gap (ensemble R² ≈ −964), highlighting the need for additional feature work beyond the scope of this fix.

## Next Steps (Owner Attention Required)

- Investigate feature engineering enhancements suitable for true 21-day forecasts (e.g., futures term-structure alignment, lag consistency, exogenous signal substitutions).
- Revisit ensemble design or introduce alternative models geared for medium-term projections.
- Use the new multi-period validation summary before relying on any forecast deliverable.

## Verification

- `python3 Gas/scripts/train_models.py --horizon 21`
- `python3 Gas/scripts/walk_forward_validation.py --horizons 21`
- `python3 Gas/scripts/train_models_october_only.py --horizon 21`
- `python3 Gas/scripts/multi_period_validation.py --horizon 21`

> **Note:** `python3 -m pytest Gas/tests/test_download_scripts.py` still fails because the legacy script layout (`Gas/scripts/download_eia_data.py`, etc.) no longer exists; this predates the current changes.
